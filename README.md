* Install Numpy&scipy
* Install PyAudio
    * `pip install pyaudio`
    * If failed to build wheel for pyaudio on Windows, download the precompiled one from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio, and install by `pip install PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl` for example. The precompile version should be consistent with the Python environment.
